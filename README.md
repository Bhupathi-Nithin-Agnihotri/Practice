1. Hello! My name is Nithin. I love playing chess and learning new & intresting things...etc.
2. Git is a Versioning Software. I love doing stuff by commands(They are cool and also handy.).
3. I can't recall any problem at the moment, but the Magic Square problem was intresting, another one is the Gray Code problem(I could'nt solve it.)
